## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g feathers-cli             # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers generate model                 # Generate a new Model
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```

## Schemas go in shared/schemas
If you want the same schema to validate both client and server side put the schema in ./shared/schemas as it's own file with the file name being the name of the schema and resulting model.

You can use `pattern` and `patternMessage` directly in the schema and it will be converted to
```
validate: {
  validator: function(v) {
    return pattern.test(v)
  },
  message: patternMessage
}
```
for you.

## Docker-compose
You may run
```
docker-compose up
```
to build a docker-virtual machine instance.
